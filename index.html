						<h2>Sanctity is Actually Possible, No Matter Your State in Life</h2>
						<q
							>Saint Rita of Cascia "With God, all things are possible." ​
							Getting married and having twin boys, this woman suffered a great
							deal of emotional pain: the murder of her husband, and the death
							of her boys. Yet she ended up becoming a nun, devoting her entire
							life to God's Will.
						</q>
						<q
							>Saint Josemaria Escriva "Those who are called to the married
							state will, with the Grace of God, find within their state
							everything they need to be holy." ​ A man who answered the call to
							the Priesthood, and was then told of his new mission, by God: to
							start Opus Dei to assist all people to love God in their day to
							day work.</q
						>
						<q
							>Mother Angelica "I want you to have a new concept of holiness.
							You've got to be holy where you are : washing dishes, at the
							office, at school. Wherever you are, you can be holy there." ​ A
							woman called to the life of a nun, with a call on top: to lead
							others in the creation of EWTN so that all people could get to
							know Our Lord remotely.</q

						<h2>Our Mission</h2>
						<p>
							To assist Catholic singles in removing the barriers that are
							keeping them from discovering their true vocation. We equip
							Catholic singles with skills that are needed in any vocation. We
							assist in deepening one's faith through knowledge, support and
							consistency.
						</p>
						<h2>Founder: Veronica Bucknell</h2>
						<p>
							My Catholic Faith is of utmost importance to me. After studying
							Theology, I went on to complete my Masters of Counselling and
							Psychotherapy. My passion is for the Sacrament of Marriage. I have
							assisted married couples through my counselling. I have a great
							desire to assist Catholic singles with skills that will benefit
							them greatly when they enter their vocation. This is the way I
							hope to intervene before there are issues in a marriage or even in
							a religious vocation.
