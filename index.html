			<h2>Sanctity is Actually Possible, No Matter Your State in Life</h2>
		</section>

			<q
				>Saint Rita of Cascia "With God, all things are possible." ​ Getting
				married and having twin boys, this woman suffered a great deal of
				emotional pain: the murder of her husband, and the death of her boys.
				Yet she ended up becoming a nun, devoting her entire life to God's Will.
			</q>
			<q
				>Saint Josemaria Escriva "Those who are called to the married state
				will, with the Grace of God, find within their state everything they
				need to be holy." ​ A man who answered the call to the Priesthood, and
				was then told of his new mission, by God: to start Opus Dei to assist
				all people to love God in their day to day work.</q
			>
			<q
				>Mother Angelica "I want you to have a new concept of holiness. You've
				got to be holy where you are : washing dishes, at the office, at school.
				Wherever you are, you can be holy there." ​ A woman called to the life
				of a nun, with a call on top: to lead others in the creation of EWTN so
				that all people could get to know Our Lord remotely.</q
