					<h2>Sanctity is Actually Possible, No Matter Your State in Life</h2>

					<q
						>Saint Rita of Cascia "With God, all things are possible." ​ Getting
						married and having twin boys, this woman suffered a great deal of
						emotional pain: the murder of her husband, and the death of her boys.
						Yet she ended up becoming a nun, devoting her entire life to God's Will.
					</q>
					<q
						>Saint Josemaria Escriva "Those who are called to the married state
						will, with the Grace of God, find within their state everything they
						need to be holy." ​ A man who answered the call to the Priesthood, and
						was then told of his new mission, by God: to start Opus Dei to assist
						all people to love God in their day to day work.</q
					>
					<q
						>Mother Angelica "I want you to have a new concept of holiness. You've
						got to be holy where you are : washing dishes, at the office, at school.
						Wherever you are, you can be holy there." ​ A woman called to the life
						of a nun, with a call on top: to lead others in the creation of EWTN so
						that all people could get to know Our Lord remotely.</q
